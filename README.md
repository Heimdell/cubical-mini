A nonstandard library for Cubical Agda
======================================

The original one has a strong tilt towards theoretical stuff.

This library may be a toolset to help you build reliable software.

Credits:

- `Structures` due to Martin Escardo, Carlo Angiuli, Evan Cavallo,
  Anders Mörtberg, Max Zeuner.
- `Categories` in this formulation were introduced by Frederik Hanghøj Iversen.
- `Cardinals` follow closely the work of Donnacha Oisín Kidney.
- `Ordinals` due to Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg et al.
- `Containers` are folklore, though I took inspiration in a talk by Thorsten
  Altenkirch and Conor McBride's lectures.
- Amélia's 1Lab is a source of immensely good tricks regarding automation,
  design and style in particular. See `Meta`, most of the `Foundations`.
