A nonstandard library for Cubical Agda
======================================

This is a fork of the usual cubical library but with `--erasure`
and `--erased-cubical` enabled by default.

Credits:
I think `Categories` in this formulation were introduced by Frederik Hanghøj Iversen.
`Cardinals` follow closely the work of Donnacha Oisín Kidney.
